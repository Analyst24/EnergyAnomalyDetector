ENERGY ANOMALY DETECTION SYSTEM - OFFLINE MODE
======================================

To run this application on your local machine, please follow these steps:

1. SQLITE DATABASE MODE:
   The system will automatically use SQLite database when no PostgreSQL connection is available.
   The database file will be created in the main directory as "energy_anomaly_detection.db"

2. RUN THE APPLICATION: 
   Open a command prompt or terminal in this directory and run:
   
   streamlit run app.py
   
   If that doesn't work, try:
   
   python -m streamlit run app.py

3. ACCESS THE APPLICATION:
   Once running, the application will be available at:
   
   http://localhost:8501
   
   (Note: Streamlit uses port 8501 by default in local mode, not 5000)

4. LOGIN CREDENTIALS:
   Default admin user:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin123
   
   Default demo user:
   - Username: demo
   - Password: demo123

5. TROUBLESHOOTING:
   If you encounter any issues:
   - Make sure you have all required packages installed (see requirements.txt)
   - Check that Python can find all modules (don't run from inside subdirectories)
   - Try running with --browser.serverAddress=127.0.0.1 if localhost doesn't work:
     streamlit run app.py --browser.serverAddress=127.0.0.1
